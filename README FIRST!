// once you cloned the repository,
// open terminal in vscode and 
// enter this one by one to start
// the development; always do this 
// when going to modify the code so 
// you can see the changes through 
// the port it will provide 

 cd LRS_Web_Application
 npm run dev

// cuz no need to re-install npm as i 
// already configured the node modules needed
// and necessary library

* if going to use github through terminal*
some commands necessary for us for git in terminal
(must have installed git first)

 git add {filename} or git add . 
(period is to add everything) 
 - this command will stage files to ready it 
   for commiting.
 
 git commit -m "message here - context of what has been modified"
 - this command will ready it for pushing(publishing) to github repository
